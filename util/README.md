# Updating Bootstrap and FuelUX

If you need to update Bootstrap and/or FuelUX, this can be accomplished by running the update.sh file from command line:

./update.sh

This will, using volo, pull down the latest changes for both projects. It will also run grunt and then present you with prompts requesting you to commit the updates.
